		<h2>1989's commercial success transformed Swift's image from a country singer-songwriter to a worldwide pop 
		phenomenon.The album was the second album to spawn five or more US top-10 singles in the 2010s decade,
		 and made Swift the second woman to have two albums each score five US top-10 hits. Its singles received 
		heavy rotation on US radio over a year and a half following its release, which Billboard described as "a kind of 
		cultural omnipresence that's rare for a 2010s album". (Swiftpedia)</h2>
