		<h2>Folklore (stylized in all lowercase) is the eighth studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift.<br>
		It was a surprise album, released on July 24, 2020, via Republic Records. After the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic <br>
		in early 2020, Swift canceled the concert tour for her seventh studio album Lover (2019). She conceived Folklore during <br>
		quarantine as "a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness", working with producers <br>
		Aaron Dessner and Jack Antonoff virtually; Dessner and Antonoff operated from recording studios in Hudson Valley and <br> 
		New York City, respectively, while Swift recorded her vocals in a home studio at her Los Angeles residence. (Wikipedia)</h2>
